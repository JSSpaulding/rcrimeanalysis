Title: An Implementation of Crime Analysis Methods
Version: 0.4.1
Author: Jamie Spaulding and Keith Morris
Maintainer: Jamie Spaulding <jspauldi@mix.wvu.edu>
Description: An implementation of functions for the analysis of crime incident or records
  management system data. The package implements analysis algorithms scaled for city
  or regional crime analysis units. The package provides functions for kernel density
  estimation for crime heat maps, geocoding using the 'Google Maps' API, identification of 
  repeat crime incidents, spatio-temporal map comparison across time intervals, time series 
  analysis (forecasting and decomposition), detection of optimal parameters for identification 
  of near repeat incidents, and near repeat analysis with crime network linkage.
