Author: Jamie Spaulding and Keith Morris
Maintainer: Jamie Spaulding <jspauldi@mix.wvu.edu>
Description: An implementation of functions for the analysis of crime incident or records
  management system data. The package implements analysis algorithms scaled for city
  or regional crime analysis units. The package provides functions for kernel density
  estimation for crime heat maps, geocoding using the 'Google Maps' API, spatio-temporal
  map comparison across time intervals, time series analysis (forecasting and decomposition),
  and near repeat analysis (with crime network linkage).
