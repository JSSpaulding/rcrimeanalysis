## Other Comments
This is a first submission of the package. Please let me know if there
is anything else that I can do to help this process.

I believe that the note is due to the pacakge being a first submission.

The win-build check identified 3 Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
RMS (8:22)
geocoding (10:35)
spatio (10:72)
I have checked and all of these words are all appropriate nomenclature for what
the process is performing.
